Retrieves resources key changes based on change version.

This operation is used to retrieve identifying information about resources whose key values have been changed.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.Apis.Profiles.Minnesota_Twenty_Four_Twenty_Five_SISVendor_Profile;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.Client;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.Models.Profiles.Minnesota_Twenty_Four_Twenty_Five_SISVendor_Profile;

namespace Example
{
    public class KeyChangesStudentSchoolAssociationsExample

        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://stage.api.education.mn.gov:443/edfiapi/data/v3/2026";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new StudentSchoolAssociationsApi(config);
            var offset = 0;  // int? | Indicates how many items should be skipped before returning results. (optional)  (default to 0)
            var limit = 25;  // int? | Indicates the maximum number of items that should be returned in the results. (optional)  (default to 25)
            var minChangeVersion = 789L;  // long? | Used in synchronization to set sequence minimum ChangeVersion (optional) 
            var maxChangeVersion = 789L;  // long? | Used in synchronization to set sequence maximum ChangeVersion (optional) 
            var totalCount = false;  // bool? | Indicates if the total number of items available should be returned in the 'Total-Count' header of the response.  If set to false, 'Total-Count' header will not be provided. (optional)  (default to false)
            var snapshotIdentifier = "snapshotIdentifier_example";  // string? | Indicates the Snapshot-Identifier that should be used. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Retrieves resources key changes based on change version.
                List<TrackedChangesEdFiStudentSchoolAssociationReadableKeyChange> result = apiInstance.KeyChangesStudentSchoolAssociations(offset, limit, minChangeVersion, maxChangeVersion, totalCount, snapshotIdentifier);

<a name="poststudentschoolassociation"></a>
# **PoststudentSchoolAssociation**
> void PoststudentSchoolAssociation (EdFiStudentSchoolAssociationWritable studentSchoolAssociation)

Creates or updates resources based on the natural key values of the supplied resource.

The POST operation can be used to create or update resources. In database terms, this is often referred to as an \"upsert\" operation (insert + update). Clients should NOT include the resource \"id\" in the JSON body because it will result in an error. The web service will identify whether the resource already exists based on the natural key values provided, and update or create the resource appropriately. It is recommended to use POST for both create and update except while updating natural key of a resource in which case PUT operation must be used.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.Apis.Profiles.Minnesota_Twenty_Four_Twenty_Five_SISVendor_Profile;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.Client;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.Models.Profiles.Minnesota_Twenty_Four_Twenty_Five_SISVendor_Profile;

namespace Example
{
    public class PoststudentSchoolAssociationExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://stage.api.education.mn.gov:443/edfiapi/data/v3/2026";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new StudentSchoolAssociationsApi(config);
            var studentSchoolAssociation = new EdFiStudentSchoolAssociationWritable(); // EdFiStudentSchoolAssociationWritable | The JSON representation of the \"studentSchoolAssociation\" resource to be created or updated.

            try
            {
                // Creates or updates resources based on the natural key values of the supplied resource.
                apiInstance.PoststudentSchoolAssociation(studentSchoolAssociation);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling StudentSchoolAssociationsApi.PoststudentSchoolAssociation: " + e.Message);
                Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using the PoststudentSchoolAssociationWithHttpInfo variant
This returns an ApiResponse object which contains the response data, status code and headers.

```csharp

<a name="putstudentschoolassociation"></a>
# **PutstudentSchoolAssociation**
> void PutstudentSchoolAssociation (string id, EdFiStudentSchoolAssociationWritable studentSchoolAssociation, string? ifMatch = null)

Updates a resource based on the resource identifier.

The PUT operation is used to update a resource by identifier. If the resource identifier (\"id\") is provided in the JSON body, it will be ignored. Additionally, if natural key values are being updated by the JSON body, those changes will be applied to the resource and will also cascade through to dependent resources.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.Apis.Profiles.Minnesota_Twenty_Four_Twenty_Five_SISVendor_Profile;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.Client;

            config.BasePath = "https://stage.api.education.mn.gov:443/edfiapi/data/v3/2026";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new StudentSchoolAssociationsApi(config);
            var id = "id_example";  // string | A resource identifier that uniquely identifies the resource.
            var studentSchoolAssociation = new EdFiStudentSchoolAssociationWritable(); // EdFiStudentSchoolAssociationWritable | The JSON representation of the \"studentSchoolAssociation\" resource to be created or updated.
            var ifMatch = "ifMatch_example";  // string? | The ETag header value used to prevent the PUT from updating a resource modified by another consumer. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Updates a resource based on the resource identifier.
                apiInstance.PutstudentSchoolAssociation(id, studentSchoolAssociation, ifMatch);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling StudentSchoolAssociationsApi.PutstudentSchoolAssociation: " + e.Message);
